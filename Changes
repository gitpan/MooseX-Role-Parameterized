Changes for MooseX-Role-Parameterized

0.03  Jan 17, 2008
    * Parameters now default to read-only, so that you no longer have to specify
      the extremely common case of: is => 'ro'

0.02  Dec 9, 2008
    * Using keywords outside of the role block is now allowed and handled.

    * The role generated by the role block is now composed with its parent role.
      This is so you can have unparameterized components to your parameterized
      roles, and so that does_role returns true if you ask about the parent
      role (instead of the anonymous parameterized role).
