Changes for MooseX-Role-Parameterized

0.09  Jun 14, 2009
    * Give all modules a version number (Sartak)

0.08  Jun 14, 2009
    * Fix mis-packaging :) (Sartak)

0.07  Jun 14, 2009
    * Leave the jules nest for github (Sartak)

    * Switch to Module::Install (Sartak)

0.06  May 12, 2009
    * Fix long-standing role-role combination bug, reported by several
      users (Sartak)

    * Documentation improvements (Sartak)

0.05  Apr 24, 2009
    * Use replace_constructor in Meta::Parameter's make_immutable (nothingmuch)

    * The & prototype hack has been obviated by Moose::Exporter goodness (rafl)

    * List examples of MooseX::Role::Parameterized roles (Sartak)

0.04  Jan 30, 2009
    * The role block now receives as an argument the consuming class or role.

0.03  Jan 17, 2009
    * Parameters now default to read-only, so that you no longer have to specify
      the extremely common case of: is => 'ro'

0.02  Dec 9, 2008
    * Using keywords outside of the role block is now allowed and handled.

    * The role generated by the role block is now composed with its parent role.
      This is so you can have unparameterized components to your parameterized
      roles, and so that does_role returns true if you ask about the parent
      role (instead of the anonymous parameterized role).
